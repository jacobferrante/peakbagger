# peakbagger
A simple crud app built with python & flask. It's a personal hiking diary, which allows you to input the name of your hike, notes about the hike and a link  to the hike on a tracking service, like strava or gaiagps. 

The backend is built using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) while trying to follow [RESTful api guidelines](https://restfulapi.net/). I used [Javascript's Fetch API](https://javascript.info/fetch-api) on the front end to retrieve the proper data. I added [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to the project for some light styling. 

This will be an ongoing project, as I enjoy the subject and building it has been a joy, as well as a great learning experience. I really enjoy working with the Flask framework, along with putting the pieces together between the front-end and back-end to create a seamless experience. 

Going forward, I would like to add pre-filled database entries for quick selection of summits to track, and maybe move to a centralized database with a full user system and authentication. I also would like to bundle it into a docker container for easy and efficient deployments.
